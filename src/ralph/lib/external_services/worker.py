    Worker for Ralph jobs on RQ.

    def perform_job(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Handles connection (wait) timeouts on RQ.

        If idle time of the worker exceeds wait timeout for connection to the
        database (for MySQL it's 8 hours by default), connection is closed by
        database server, but Django still thinks it has open connection to the
        DB. This ends with errors like 'Lost connection to MySQL server' or
        'MySQL server has gone away' (or similar for other backends).

        Solution below fixes this bug by closing connections before and after
        each job on worker and forcing Django to open a new one.

        This comes in pair with `CONN_MAX_AGE` settings (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-CONN_MAX_AGE).  # noqa
        To properly handle closing connection when using persistent connections
        to the database, it's value should be lower than wait timeout of the
        database server.
