In the new year, we continue to push the Ralph project forward. 
We decided to stick to one-week cadence for releases, and we're proud to say, that we already shipped 522 releases as for the day of writing this summary!
Ralph releases have new names related to dates, for example "ralph-20190208.1"

Now, let's see what's new in 2019.

We started new year with the official support for Ubuntu 18.04 and Docker. We also redesigned the homepage from scratch, to better discover 
Ralph features. Online demo site got some updates, and there's a new documentation layout and articles about workflows.

In addition, there are new features and ehancements available:

- SIM Card's registration, with the Workflows integration, API exposition, and bulk adding features.
- Bugfixes and improvements
