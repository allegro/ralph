Catalog of prices
=================

In order to be able to calculate the costs and prices of devices, Ralph needs to
have a database of different device and component models together with their
purchase prices. That catalog is accessible to everyone who have the permission
to edit financial data, and it can be reached via the "Catalog" main menu
option.

The catalog lists different types of devices and components, which in turn
contain groups of different models. Once you gather specific models into a
group, you can specify that group's price, as well as additional options that
affect how the total price is computed.

If the "this price if per unit of size" option is not selected, then the
purchase price is used directly, per unit. Otherwise, the price of the unit
depends on its size, calculated using the provided multiplier.
